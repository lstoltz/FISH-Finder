# FISH-Finder
GUI for complete dissolved oxygen sensor calibration and data cleaning. This GUI works on an "inbox/outbox" system, with set up input required by the user. 

## How to use:
Simply run the python script or exe file and then GUI will ask the user to select a folder where data are located, and another folder for the data to be sent upon completion. For best practices, keep a copy of the data being processed with FISH-finder, as the program modifies files in the data source folder.

## Disclaimer:
This program was designed to work with Lowell Instruments Deck Data Hub files. Trying to process files not conforming to this file/folder structure may result in unintended outcomes.
